A left rotation operation on an array of size shifts each of the array's
elements unit to the left. 

For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on
array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array of n integers and a number d, write a Java method that
performs d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a
single line of space-separated integers. 



Example input: [1,2,3,4,5],2

Example output: [3,4,5,1,2]

Example input: [1,2,3,4,5],-2

Example output: [4,5,1,2,3]
